# Analysis of Ford GoBike System Data
## by Jonathan Akwasi Adusei


## Dataset

> The data is acquired from Ford GoBike, a bike-sharing service. It was established in 2013 and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. The system partnered with the well-known firm Ford Motor in 2017, and they now have approximately 3,000 bicycles and 270 stations in northern California. The dataset for this project contains information about GoBike system rides and has approximately 1.9 million records since the fiscal year 2018. I analysed data from the San Francisco Bay Area in 2019. 

> The Features of the dataset includes the following:
•	Member Year of Birth
•	Member Gender
•	User Type (Subscriber or Customer – “Subscriber” = Member or “Customer” = Casual)
•	Trip Duration(in seconds)
•	Bike ID
•	Start Time and Date
•	End Time and Date
•	Start Station ID
•	End Station ID
•	Start Station Name
•	End Station Name
•	End Station Latitude
•	End Station Longitude
•	Start Station Latitude
•	Start Station Longitude


## Summary of Findings

> Following an investigation of the dataset for the months of February and March 2019, the following conclusions were reached. Between the ages of 20 and 40, the age distribution is more concentrated. Market St at 10th St and San Francisco Caltrain Station 2 were the most frequently used start and end stations (Townsend St at 4th St). The majority of trips were taken on Thursdays and Tuesdays, with the fewest on weekends. Weekend trip durations, on the other hand, were longer than weekday trip durations. Peak hours are when people are going to work in the morning (8 and 9 a.m.) and when they leave in the evening (17 and 18 p.m.). Approximately 90% of the trips were taken by subscribers. Bike sharing accounted for less than ten percent of total trips. Although males made up the majority of trips (more than 70%), females spent more time on their trips than males. Only subscribers are permitted to ride on trips together. Customer type has no effect on the number of trips per weekday. Customers travel for longer periods of time than subscribers, regardless of the day of the week.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> 1.	The higher ride frequencies in the morning (8th and 9th hrs) and evening (17th and 18th hrs) can be attributed to rush hours when people leave for work and return later in the evening. 
> 2.	Trips by customer user type last longer than trips by subscriber user type. 
> 3.	Weekend trips last longer than weekday trips.
